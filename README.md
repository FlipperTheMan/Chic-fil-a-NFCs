# Chic-fil-a-NFCs
Repo of Chic-fil-a NFC's attached to the tables inside the restaurant.

This is a repo of CFA NFC's I've captured using the Flipper Zero. Once capturing "Table 33", I emulated the NFC with the app while ordering food via the CFA iPhone app, finding it successfully emulated the "Table 33" NFC. 

As far as I've determined, it is likely these NFC's are not restaurant specific, as it would create too much of a burden on the app to determine the restaurant location, and the associated NFC for the table. If anyone has further information regarding this please let me know. 

To add these NFC's to your Flipper Zero, use the qFlipper program to download them into the NFC folder, located in your SD Card.
