# Chic-fil-a-NFCs
Repo of Chic-fil-a NFC's attached to the tables inside the restaurant.

This is a repo of CFA NFC's I've captured using the Flipper Zero. As far as I've determined, these NFC's are not restaurant specific, as it would create too much of a burden on the app to determine the restaurant location, and the associated NFC for the table. If anyone has further information regarding this please let me know. 

Once capturing "Table 33", I emulated the NFC with the app while ordering food via the CFA iPhone app, finding it successfully emulated the "Table 33" NFC. 

It should go without saying, but this should not be used for illegal or unethical purposes. Be kind to the Chick-fil-A, it's God's chosen chicken sandwich. 

IF SOMEONE WOULD WISH TO BUY ME COFFEE, PLEASE DO ME A BIG FAVOR. PLEASE TAKE A BOX OF DONUTS TO YOUR LOCAL FIREHOUSE OR AMBULANCE SERVICE, AND TELL THEM IT'S FROM YOUR FRIENDLY NEIGHBORHOOD FLIPPER. WE LOVE DONUTS!
